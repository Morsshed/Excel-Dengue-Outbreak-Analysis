#### Findings

###### Population & Overall Infection

The dataset covers a total population of 1,000 individuals.

36 distinct areas are identified as dengue-affected zones.

The overall infection rate is high at 53%, indicating widespread transmission.

The average patient age is 36 years, showing dengue is most prevalent among the working-age population.

Repeated infections (259 cases) suggest ongoing exposure and incomplete immunity.

###### Gender-Based Insights

Females account for 52.7% of total infections, slightly higher than males (47.3%).

This indicates females are marginally more vulnerable, possibly due to household exposure or caregiving roles.

Gender distribution shows dengue affects both genders almost equally, requiring inclusive prevention strategies.

######  Infection Status & History

100% of cases in the dataset are recently infected, showing the data reflects an active outbreak.

51.4% of patients were not previously infected, indicating first-time exposure is common.

48.6% had prior dengue infections, increasing the risk of severe complications.

Nearly half the patients face reinfection risk, which is clinically significant for dengue severity.

######  Early vs Late Stage Infection

97.4% of patients are in the early stage of dengue infection.

Only 2.6% progressed to late-stage dengue, indicating early detection.

Early diagnosis significantly reduces hospitalization and fatality risks.

However, early-stage dominance also signals rapid virus spread in the community.

######  Age-Wise Analysis

Adults (189 cases) and Middle-aged individuals (175 cases) show the highest infection counts.

These two groups together represent over 60% of total infections.

Children and adolescents show lower infection counts, possibly due to controlled exposure.

Elderly infection rate is the lowest, but poses higher health risk if infected.

######  Area & Housing Insights

Densely populated urban areas (e.g., Jatrabari, Demra, Mirpur) show the highest infection numbers.

Undeveloped areas report higher infections than developed ones.

Buildings in undeveloped areas (96 cases) show the highest infection concentration.

Poor sanitation and stagnant water are strong contributors to mosquito breeding.

Housing type and infrastructure quality play a critical role in dengue spread.

#### Recommendations
###### Target High-Risk Age Groups

Prioritize adults and middle-aged populations for awareness campaigns.

Focus on workplaces, offices, and public transport hubs.

###### Strengthen Vector Control in Undeveloped Areas

Improve waste management and drainage systems.

Conduct regular fogging and larvicide spraying in high-risk zones.

###### Early Detection & Community Screening

Expand early-stage screening programs at community clinics.

Promote symptom awareness for timely diagnosis and treatment.

###### Focus on Reinfection Prevention

Monitor patients with previous dengue history closely.

Educate communities on risks of secondary dengue infection.

###### Gender-Inclusive Public Health Strategy

Design prevention programs targeting both men and women.

Address household-level exposure, especially for women.
