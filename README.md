## Problem Statement

Dengue fever has emerged as a significant public health challenge in Bangladesh, particularly in densely populated urban areas. Rapid urbanization, inadequate waste management, and climate conditions have contributed to the increasing spread of dengue infections. Health authorities require data-driven insights to identify high-risk populations, affected regions, and infection patterns in order to design targeted interventions and reduce disease severity and recurrence. This project aims to analyze, visualize, and interpret dengue infection data to uncover demographic, geographic, and clinical trends that can support early detection, effective resource allocation, and preventive healthcare planning.

### Brief Description

This analysis examines a dataset of 1,000 individuals across 36 affected areas in Bangladesh to understand how dengue infections vary by age, gender, location, housing conditions, and infection history. The study focuses on identifying infection intensity, recurrence patterns, and early vs late-stage detection, using interactive dashboards and visual analytics.By integrating demographic and geographic insights, the project supports evidence-based decision-making for public health officials, enabling them to prioritize high-risk zones, vulnerable groups, and preventive strategies to control dengue outbreaks more effectively.

### Key Issues:

► What is the overall dengue infection rate, and how severe is the outbreak?

► Which age groups are most affected by dengue infections?

► Are there gender-based differences in dengue susceptibility?

► Which geographic areas report the highest number of infections?

► How does housing type and area development influence infection rates?

► What proportion of patients are new vs previously infected?

► How prevalent are repeated dengue infections, and what risks do they pose?

► At what stage are most infections detected (early vs late stage)?

► Which population groups are at higher risk of severe dengue outcomes?

► How can early diagnosis trends improve healthcare response?

► Which areas should be prioritized for mosquito control programs?

► What insights can help reduce reinfection and recurrence rates?

► How can demographic data support targeted public health campaigns?

► What preventive strategies can minimize future dengue outbreaks?

#### Findings

###### Population & Overall Infection

● The dataset covers a total population of 1,000 individuals.

● 36 distinct areas are identified as dengue-affected zones.

● The overall infection rate is high at 53%, indicating widespread transmission.

● The average patient age is 36 years, showing dengue is most prevalent among the working-age population.

● Repeated infections (259 cases) suggest ongoing exposure and incomplete immunity.

###### Gender-Based Insights

● Females account for 52.7% of total infections, slightly higher than males (47.3%).

● This indicates females are marginally more vulnerable, possibly due to household exposure or caregiving roles.

● Gender distribution shows dengue affects both genders almost equally, requiring inclusive prevention strategies.

######  Infection Status & History

● 100% of cases in the dataset are recently infected, showing the data reflects an active outbreak.

● 51.4% of patients were not previously infected, indicating first-time exposure is common.

● 48.6% had prior dengue infections, increasing the risk of severe complications.

● Nearly half the patients face reinfection risk, which is clinically significant for dengue severity.

######  Early vs Late Stage Infection

● 97.4% of patients are in the early stage of dengue infection.

● Only 2.6% progressed to late-stage dengue, indicating early detection.

● Early diagnosis significantly reduces hospitalization and fatality risks.

● However, early-stage dominance also signals rapid virus spread in the community.

######  Age-Wise Analysis

● Adults (189 cases) and Middle-aged individuals (175 cases) show the highest infection counts.

● These two groups together represent over 60% of total infections.

● Children and adolescents show lower infection counts, possibly due to controlled exposure.

● Elderly infection rate is the lowest, but poses higher health risk if infected.

######  Area & Housing Insights

● Densely populated urban areas (e.g., Jatrabari, Demra, Mirpur) show the highest infection numbers.

● Undeveloped areas report higher infections than developed ones.

● Buildings in undeveloped areas (96 cases) show the highest infection concentration.

● Poor sanitation and stagnant water are strong contributors to mosquito breeding.

● Housing type and infrastructure quality play a critical role in dengue spread.

#### Recommendations
###### Target High-Risk Age Groups

 ✓ Prioritize adults and middle-aged populations for awareness campaigns.

 ✓ Focus on workplaces, offices, and public transport hubs.

###### Strengthen Vector Control in Undeveloped Areas

 ✓ Improve waste management and drainage systems.

 ✓ Conduct regular fogging and larvicide spraying in high-risk zones.

###### Early Detection & Community Screening

 ✓ Expand early-stage screening programs at community clinics.

 ✓ Promote symptom awareness for timely diagnosis and treatment.

###### Focus on Reinfection Prevention

 ✓ Monitor patients with previous dengue history closely.

 ✓ Educate communities on risks of secondary dengue infection.

###### Gender-Inclusive Public Health Strategy

 ✓ Design prevention programs targeting both men and women.

 ✓ Address household-level exposure, especially for women.
